#Software Patterns






I did not found a name for those patterns, so I gave them the name of software *PicoPatterns*.
 - Software Patterns talk about how **classes** interact with each other to solve a big problem.
 - Software MicroPatterns talk about how a **methods** for a single class interact with each other (sometimes in reference to another class) to solve a class-level problem.
 - Software PicoPatterns talk about **statements** interact with each other to solve a tiny problem.
